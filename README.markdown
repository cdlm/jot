# Class and template files for the Journal of Object Technology

This package provides the LaTeX files necessary to typeset articles for submission to the [Journal of Object Technology (JOT)](http://www.jot.fm).

## Quick start

Authors just need the following files:

* `paper-template.tex`: a template for new articles
* `jot.cls`: the LaTeX class file defining the style

Just copy `jot.cls` somewhere LaTeX can find it, and start from `paper-template.tex` to edit your article. (Rename it appropriately.)

All other files are for the manual.  `jot-manual.pdf` explains in detail how to use the JOT style to write articles.  `jot-manual.tex` also serves as an extended example of using the style.


## Download

A zip download is available from the [author instructions page](http://www.jot.fm/authors.html).

The complete project resides on the [JOT github repository](https://github.com/jotfm/jot).
