# Class and template files for the Journal of Object Technology

This package provides the LaTeX files necessary to typeset articles for submission to the [Journal of Object Technology (JOT)](http://www.jot.fm).


## Download

See the [author instructions](http://www.jot.fm/authors.html), or download the most recent version from [the github repository](http://github.com/jotfm/jot/archives/master).


## Quick start

Authors really only need these two files:

* `jot/jot.cls`: the LaTeX class file, defining the style.
* `jot/paper.tex`: a skeleton for new articles.

Just copy `jot.cls` somewhere LaTeX can find it, and start from `paper.tex` to edit your article.

All other files are for the manual; to obtain it from sources, simply compile `jot-manual.tex`.
